# LFE Programming Rules and Conventions

## 9 Common Mistakes

* Writing functions which span many pages (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/7.html">Chapter 7</a>, "Don't 
  write very long functions"). 
* Writing functions with deeply nested if's receive's, case's etc (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/7.html">Chapter 7</a>,  
  "Don't write deeply nested code"). 
* Writing badly typed functions (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/6.html">Chapter 6</a>, "Use 
  tagged return values"). 
* Function names which do not reflect what the functions do (See
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/7.html">Chapter 7</a>,
  "Function names"). 
* Variable names which are meaningless (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/7.html">Chapter 7</a>,
  "Variable names"). 
* Using processes when they are not needed (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/5.html">Chapter 5</a>,
  "Assign exactly one parallel process to each true concurrent activity in 
  the system"). 
* Badly chosen data structures (Bad representations). 
* Bad comments or no comments at all (always document arguments and return 
  value). 
* Unindented code. 
* Using put/get (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/6.html">Chapter 6</a>,
  "Use the process dictionary with extreme care"). 
* No control of the message queues (see
  <a href="http://lfe.github.io/prog-rules/5.html">Chapter 5</a>, "Flush unknown messages" and "Time-outs" in the same chapter).
