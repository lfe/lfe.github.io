## 1.6 Loading Files

### 1.6.1 Loading Files in the REPL

There are several ways in which one may load files in LFE.

#### 1.6.1.1 ```slurp```

As mentioned in the section on
<a href="/user-guide/intro/2.html">LFE's REPL</a>, ```slurp```ing a file makes
all functions and macros defined in the file available in the shell. One does
not need to reference the module (and, in fact, attempting to do so will result
in an error. Also, note that only one file can be slurped at a time; slurping a
new one removes all data about the previous file.
{% highlight cl %}
> (slurp '"my-module.lfe")
#(ok my-module)
>
{% endhighlight %}

#### 1.6.1.2 ```c```

Compiling a module from the REPL is what you need if you wish to work with
multiple modules simultaneously:
{% highlight cl %}
> (c '"my-module")
#(module my-module)
>
{% endhighlight %}

#### 1.6.1.3 ```ec```

You can also load Erlang files in LFE:
{% highlight cl %}
> (ec '"../lfe/src/lfe_macro.erl")
#(ok lfe_macro)
>
{% endhighlight %}

#### 1.6.1.4 ```l```

If a module is in your Erlang/LFE path,  you can load that too:
{% highlight cl %}
> (l 'mochiweb)
(#(module mochiweb))
>
{% endhighlight %}

### 1.6.2 Loading Files in Modules

Code may be included wholesale into LFE modules by either using
```include-file``` or ```include-lib```.

#### 1.6.2.1 ```include-file```

If you have records or data that you would like to be available to more than
one module, you can put those in a dedicated file and pull them in to your
modules. For example, let's say I had defined the following constants in the
file ```include/consts.lfe```:

{% highlight cl %}
(defmacro *base-cool-factor* _ `0.8)
(defmacro *earth-adjustment* _ `0.3)
{% endhighlight %}

Then, in the following two files I could easily use those constants by
including them:
{% highlight cl %}
(defmodule zaphod
  (export all)

(include-file "include/consts.lfe")

(defun get-coolness ()
  (let ((zaphod-cool-factor 0.9))
    (* (*base-cool-factor*) zaphod-cool-factor)))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cl %}
(defmodule arthur
  (export all)

(include-file "include/consts.lfe")

(defun get-coolness ()
  (let ((arthur-cool-factor 0.1))
    (* (*base-cool-factor*) (*earth-adjustment*) arthur-cool-factor)))
{% endhighlight %}

#### 1.6.2.2 ```include-lib```

{% highlight cl %}
{% endhighlight %}
