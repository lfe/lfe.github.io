#### Important!
####
#### The LFE landing page is a complex arrangement of various widgets
#### which each need to pull their data from specific variables defined
#### in this [extra] section of the Zola config.
####
#### Due to this wild variety on the home page, the actual Markdown
#### content for this file isn't used; it's the metadata that fills
#### all the home page widgets.
####
#### To make this easier to read, the variables have been grouped with
#### their sections via comment dividers below.

###   Quotes   ################################################

quotes = '''
LFE is a proper Lisp, 100% compatible with Core Erlang and able to take full
advantage of OTP.

Light-weight, massive concurrency.
Fault tolerance.
Continuous operation with no downtime.
Full distributed systems.
Asynchronous communication.
Process isolation.
Soft real-time.

Immutable data.
Fixed set of data types.
Pattern matching.
Functional programming language.
Support for modules.
No global data.

Runs efficiently on the BEAM.
Seamless Erlang interop, including the ecosystem of Erlang libraries.

"It is because of you, mother*@#$%, that we are not all using Lisp"
"I'm sorry, what was that last part again? Did you just say 'Lisp'?"

Taking the Syntax out of Distributed Systems Programming

We're Syntactically and Semantically Chaotic

Curly braces go home!

LFE: Where even a distributed Prolog dare not go.

MACLISP and supervision trees are all that anyone needs.

LFE: Fifty Shades of Distributed, Syntax-Free Message-Passing.

Come for the Lisp, stay for the Erlang/OTP.

Come for the fault-tolerance and high-availability. Stay for the fault-tolerance and high-availability.

LFE is _way_ cooler than FOCAL.
What's "FOCAL"?
See?!

LFE comes with a powerful REPL, supporting interactive development
(including writing macros!) as well as running scripts or even evaluating
arbitrary LFE code via the command line.
'''

[extra.excerpts.simple_types]

name = "Simple Types"
id = "core-types"
code = '''
```lisp
lfe> (== 42 #b101010)
true

lfe> (integer_to_list 42 2)
"101010"

lfe> #\a
97

lfe> "regular string"
"regular string"

lfe> #"binary string"
#"binary string"
```
'''
desc = '''
Note that in LFE and Erlang a string is really just a list of integers;
there is no "string" type. There is, however, an "atom" type in LFE; this would be analogous to the Lisp symbol. For example, `'my-atom`, or if the atom has spaces in it, `'|my atom|`.
'''

[extra.excerpts.compound_types]

name = "Compound Types"
id = "data-struct"
code = '''
```lisp
;; Lists
lfe> '(a b c 1 2 5)
(a b c 1 2 5)

;; Tuples
lfe> #("element 1" 2 elem-3)
#("element 1" 2 elem-3)

;; Maps
lfe> #m(key1 "value 1"
        "key 2" value-2)
#M("key 2" value-2 key1 "value 1")


```
'''
desc = '''
In LFE lists are like they are in a Lisp (except they also include
strings). Additionally, LFE has tuples (Lisp vectors) and maps
(Lisp has tables). LFE has property lists, dicts, and ordered dicts
from Erlang, supported via additional libraries.
'''

[extra.excerpts.records]

name = "Records"
id = "records"
code = '''
```lisp
;; Defining a record automatically generates a set of
;; useful functions for that particular record.
lfe> (defrecord person
       name
       address
       age)
set-person-age

;; Use the generated record constructor:
lfe> (make-person name "Ford Prefect"
                       address "Betelgeuse Seven"
                       age 234))
#(person "Ford Prefect" "Betelgeuse Seven" 234)

desc = '''
Like all data in LFE, records can be pattern-matched. Pattern matching
on record field names and data in function arguments is an extremely powerful
capability provided to developers.

[extra.excerpts.funcs]

name = "Functions"
id = "funcs"
code = '''
```lisp
;; A recursive function with pattern matching:
lfe> (defun ackermann

       ((m n) (ackermann (- m 1)
                         (ackermann m (- n 1)))))

;; Call the function
lfe> (ackermann 3 4)
125

;; Apply the function
lfe> (funcall #'ackermann/2 3 4))
125
```
'''
desc = '''
As well as supporting the standard Lisp syntax for `defun`,
LFE functions support pattern matching in arguments, allowing you to create
concise, expressive, and elegant code.
'''

[extra.excerpts.macros]

name = "Macros"
id = "macros"
code = '''
```lisp
;; LFE and Erlang do not support n-arity functions, but
;; you can write a Lisp macro to get around that :-)
lfe> (defmacro mean args
       `(/ (lists:sum ,args)
           ,(length args)))

;; Use the macro with different numbers of arguments:
lfe> (mean 1)
1.0
lfe> (mean 1 2)
1.5
lfe> (mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 42 108)
21.375

```
'''
desc = '''
LFE macros are unhygenic, but with scoped variables. There is no `gensym` in
LFE due to this being unsafe in long-lived, distributed code (LFE supports
sharing code with remote nodes). With the exception of running in the REPL,
macros are only compile-time.

'''
desc = '''
Here we have two examples of directly calling Erlang functions
from LFE. First, we're "folding" (a.k.a "reducing") over a list
of items, multiplying them by the accumulated value, and then further
transforming using other Erlang functions. Then we are calling an
Erlang function to get information about a particular supervision tree.

```
'''
desc = '''
OTP is what you use when you need to create industrial grade applications
and services; there's nothing quite like it in the programming world. As
such, it has inspired countless imitations in a great many other programming
languages. In LFE, you get to use the real deal.
