# Quick Start

## 2 Your First LFE Project

A project? Already?! It sounds daunting, but it's just one command :-)

Head over to your favorite workspace in an open terminal and do this:

```bash
$ lfetool new library my-test-lib
```

Note that this does require the most recent release of Erlang right now (r16).
(We are working towards full support for r15 and will update this Quick Start
when that has landed.)

As you watch the output crank away, read on to find out what it's doing:

* ``lfetool`` created a skeleton project (of the "library" type)
* ``rebar`` downloaded all the dependencies listed in the new
  ``rebar.config`` file that was created for your project
* All the downloaded dependendencies were then compiled
* During the first step, a failing test case was created for you; now, that
  test case has been run in the test suite and the error has been revealed
  (TDD!)


### 2.1 Tests First!

First things first: let's get that failing unit test passing.

Here's the output we saw:

```erlang
**error:{assertEqual_failed,[{module,'my-test-lib_tests'},
                     {line,11},
                     {expression,"(: my-test-lib my-adder 2 2)"},
                     {expected,4},
                     {value,5}]}
```

We can see that our test expected 4 but it got 5.

Before we go further, be sure you are in your project directory:

```bash
$ cd my-test-lib
```

Let's look at the test by opening up ``test/my-test-lib_tests.lfe``.

Well, things there look good -- we should get 4 when 2 and 2 are added.

Let's take a look at the source module: ``src/my-test-lib.lfe``. Ah-ha! a
bug :-) There's an extra operation that's being done which we don't want.

To fix it, change this line:

```cl
  (+ x (+ y 1)))
```

to this:

```cl
  (+ x y))
```

Now re-run the unit tests:

```bash
$ make check-no-deps
```

And you should get a passing test:

```bash
==> my-test-lib (eunit)
======================== EUnit ========================
my-test-lib_tests: my-adder_test (module 'my-test-lib_tests')...[0.031 s] ok
=======================================================
  Test passed.
```

We'll talk about the ``make`` targets in a bit, but our target above run the
unit tests without recompiling all the deps; just our project files and
our unit tests.


### 2.2 Project Inventory

Okay, we've got our tests passing and our project looks healthy. But what does
it have in it?

* a README file in ReStructured Text
* a ``Makefile``
* the ``rebar.config`` file we mentioned earlier (this has all your project
  dependencies in it)
* a ``package.exs`` file for uploading your project to
  <a href="http://expm.co">expm.co</a>
* the ``src`` directory which holds your project code, and
* the ``test`` directory which holds the tests

There are some other things there (e.g., the ``deps`` directory created by ``rebar``
and the ``ebin`` directory that's created when everything is compiled).


### 2.3 Repo Ready to Go

``lfetool`` also did one more thing for you: ``init``ed the project in git
and added all the files:

```bash
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   .gitignore
#   new file:   Makefile
#   new file:   README.rst
#   new file:   package.exs
#   new file:   rebar.config
#   new file:   src/my-test-lib.app.src
#   new file:   src/my-test-lib.lfe
#   new file:   test/my-test-lib_tests.lfe
#
```
All you need to do it ``git commit -a && git push --all`` to wherever you want
to put your project :-)


### Next Stop

You can taste it, can't you? That LFE flavor coming your way? Yup, you're right.
You're going to be looking at LFE code next ...
