# Quick Start

## 3 Using Libraries

### 3.1 OTP Modules

Taking advantage of the
<a href="http://erldocs.com/R15B/index.html?i=734#stdlib">Erlang stdlib</a> is
straightforward. All you need to do is prepend the call with a ```:``` and
adjust to use the LFE syntax vs. the Erlang styntax.

In fact, we've already seen an example of this in Section 2
when we called ```(: io format ...)``` as part of a "Hello World."

Here's an example ```base64``` usage from the Erlang ```stdlib```:

{% highlight cl %}
> (: base64 encode_to_string '"Space is big. Really big.")
"U3BhY2UgaXMgYmlnLiBSZWFsbHkgYmlnLg=="
> (: base64 decode_to_string '"QW5kIHNvIHRoZSBVbml2ZXJzZSBlbmRlZC4=")
"And so the Universe ended."
{% endhighlight %}

### 3.2 Processes in LFE

One of the first things that people want to do with LFE is examine the message
passing syntax so that they can compare it with vanilla Erlang. Here's a small
example of what this looks like in LFE:

{% highlight cl %}
(defun print-result ()
  (receive (msg
    (: io format '"Received message: '~s'~n" (list msg))
    (print-result))))
{% endhighlight %}

If that was saved in a module called ```messenger```, then one could utilize it
thusly:
{% highlight cl %}
> (set pid (spawn 'messenger 'print-result ()))
<0.34.0>
> (! pid '"Ford is missing.")
"Ford is missing."
Received message: 'Ford is missing.'
{% endhighlight %}

For  more information on working with processes in LFE, be sure to view the
<a href="/tutorials/processes/1.html">tutorial</a>.

Related to this, you can file details and discussion around OTP and creating
your own serviers, see the
<a href="/tutorials/otp-servers/1.html">OTP Servers tutorial</a>.

### 3.3 Third-Party Libraries

Finally, accessing code that is written in third-party libraries is exactly the
same. Simply use the modules they have provided. If you started the LFE REPL
pointing to your third-party libraries with a ```-pa``` (path) option, then all
you have to do is this:

{% highlight cl %}
> (: your-module some-function '"some parameter")
{% endhighlight %}

That's it!
