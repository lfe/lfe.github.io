# 6 Checks, Errors, and Tests

## 6.2 Exception Handling

Erlang, and thus LFE, provide a means of evaluating expressions and not only
handling normal results, but abnormal termination as well. This is done with

Note that ```(try ... )``` doesn't need to have a ```(catch ...)```, however,
since we will be exploring exception handling in this section, all of our
examples will be using ```(catch ...)```.
