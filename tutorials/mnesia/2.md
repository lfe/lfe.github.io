# Tutorial: Mnesia

## 2 Getting Started

### 2.1 Download the Tutorial Project

To help you get started more quickly, we've provided a repo with some helper
tools in them. The rest of the tutorial will refer to this project. Here it is:

```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/lfe/mnesia-tutorial.git
    $ cd mnesia-tutorial
```

Next, let's get all the dependencies downloaded and built:

```bash
    $ make compile
```

Okay, we're ready to go :-) You can start up an mnesia-ready LFE REPL by using
a ``make`` target we provided in the ``Makefile`` for you. You need to pass it
the path of the database you want to correct, stored in an environment variable:

```bash
    $ DB=/tmp/funky make mnesia-shell
```

This will dump you into the shell, ready to start dataing:

```cl
    Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] ...

    LFE Shell V5.10.1 (abort with ^G)
>
```

If you did want to execute a manual command analogous to the ``make`` target,
you could do this, with the assumption that you're using the LFE from your
project's ``deps`` directory:

```bash
    $ ERL_LIBS=./deps/lfe:. ./deps/lfe/bin/lfe -mnesia dir '"/tmp/funky"'
```

### 2.1 First Run

You're now in the LFE REPL, so let's create a new database on disk, start it
up, and then create a table:

```cl
    > (mnesia:create_schema (list (node)))
    ok
    > (mnesia:start)
    ok
    > (mnesia:create_table 'funky '())
    #(atomic ok)
    >
```

We can take a look at our creation with this command:

```cl
    (mnesia:info)
```

Which should give you something like this:

```erlang
    ---> Processes holding locks <---
    ---> Processes waiting for locks <---
    ---> Participant transactions <---
    ---> Coordinator transactions <---
    ---> Uncertain transactions <---
    ---> Active tables <---
    funky          : with 0        records occupying 317      words of mem
    schema         : with 2        records occupying 541      words of mem
    ===> System info in version "4.8", debug level = none <===
    opt_disc. Directory "/tmp/funky" is used.
    use fallback at restart = false
    running db nodes   = [nonode@nohost]
    stopped db nodes   = []
    master node tables = []
    remote             = []
    ram_copies         = [funky]
    disc_copies        = [schema]
    disc_only_copies   = []
    [{nonode@nohost,disc_copies}] = [schema]
    [{nonode@nohost,ram_copies}] = [funky]
    3 transactions committed, 0 aborted, 0 restarted, 2 logged to disc
    0 held locks, 0 in queue; 0 local transactions, 0 remote
    0 transactions waits for other nodes: []
    ok
```

You can quit the REPL now, as we'll restart it in the next section.


### Next

We've had a little taste, next we're going to spend some time getting to know
Mnesia a little better.
