## Nothing Quite Compares...

...To the taste of Erlang, aged in the oaken barrels of Lisp, served at a
temperature of perfect hotness. New to LFE? Check out our
<a href="/quick-start/1.html">Quick Start</a> guide!

### What Is This?

You are at the home page of LFE --
<a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/">Lisp Flavoured Erlang</a>
-- a Lisp syntax front-end to the Erlang compiler. LFE is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp-1_vs._Lisp-2#The_function_namespace">Lisp-2</a>,
like Common Lisp, and comes with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a> (shell) for use with
interactive coding.

LFE coexists seamlessly with vanilla Erlang and OTP. As such, code written in
LFE can freely be used together with modules written in vanilla Erlang and
applications in Erlang/OTP.

### Features

Below are a selection of code samples representing features available in LFE.
There's much more to see, though -- so don't forget to visit the
<a href="/docs.html">Docs</a> page!

#### Records

Records are very simple in LFE. They are created with the ```defrecord``` form
like so:

{% highlight cl %}
(defrecord person
  name
  address
  age)
{% endhighlight %}

For more information, see the
<a href="/tutorials/records/1.html">tutorial on LFE records</a>.

#### Pattern Matching

The power of Erlang's pattern matching is available in Lisp form:

{% highlight cl %}
(let (((tuple name place age) #("Ford Prefect" "Betelgeuse Seven" 234)))
  (list name place age))
{% endhighlight %}

For more information, see the
<a href="/user-guide/intro/1.html">User Guide</a> as well as the
<a href="/tutorials/patterns/1.html">tutorial on pattern matching</a>.

#### Macros

Here are a couple example LFE macros:

{% highlight cl %}
(defmacro caar (x) `(car (car ,x)))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cl %}
(defmacro list*
  ((list e) e)
  ((cons e es) `(cons ,e (list* . ,es)))
  (() ()))
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the functionality represented by the LFE code above was implemented
internally in Erlang, not in LFE itself.

### More Shiny!

For those that can't wait, here's an example client/server in action:

{% highlight cl %}
(defmodule ping_pong
  (export (start_link 0) (ping 0))
  (export (init 1) (handle_call 3) (handle_cast 2)
          (handle_info 2) (terminate 2) (code_change 3))
  (behaviour gen_server)) ;Just indicates intent

(defun start_link ()
  (: gen_server start_link
    (tuple 'local 'ping_pong) 'ping_pong (list) (list)))

;; Client API
(defun ping ()
  (: gen_server call 'ping_pong 'ping))

;; Gen_server callbacks
(defrecord state (pings 0))

(defun init (args)
  (tuple 'ok (make-state pings 0)))

(defun handle_call (req from state)
  (let* ((new-count (+ (state-pings state) 1))
         (new-state (set-state-pings state new-count)))
    (tuple 'reply
           (tuple 'pong new-count)
           new-state)))

(defun handle_cast (msg state)
  (tuple 'noreply state))

(defun handle_info (info state)
  (tuple 'noreply state))

(defun terminate (reason state)
  'ok)

(defun code_change (old-vers state extra)
  (tuple 'ok state))
{% endhighlight %}

### Cool! How do I start?
LFE documentation is maintained in the source code in the
<a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/tree/master/doc">doc directory</a>.
There is also a <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/wiki">wiki</a> with
some excellent content presented there.  However, the site you are currently
reading is attempting to provide a gentler and more verbose introduction to
Lisp Flavored Erlang. We aim to accomplish this in two important ways:

* First, with a <a href="/quick-start/1.html">Quick Start</a>. This page gives
  a nice general overview of LFE, providing some content as well as a sense of
  what you can do with it.
* Secondly, over time, we will be providing a more detailed version of the
  source code documentation in the <a href="/docs">Docs</a> section of this
  site. Note, however, that for now, those pages are currently under active
  development.

A final resource for the curious and motivated is available in the
<a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/tree/master/examples">examples</a>
directory of the project repo. Each sample provides functioning code that
shows how to use LFE in larger contexts.

Enjoy!
