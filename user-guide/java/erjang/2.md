# 10 Java Interop


## 10.2 Lisp Flavored Erjang


### 10.2.3 Getting Started

As you might expect, we use ``lfetool`` to work with Erjang :-) Here's how you
install it:

```bash
$ lfetool install erjang
```

On a fast internet connection, this should take less than 3 minutes to download
Erjang, download Erlang/OTP, and then create the necessary ``.jar`` files.
Once ``lfetool`` has downloaded, compiled, and installed Erjang, you'll be
ready for the next step: hopping into the REPL:

```bash
$ lfetool repl jlfe
LFE Shell V5.10.4 (abort with ^G)
```

```cl
> (* 2 (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6))
42
> (* 2 (lists:foldl (lambda (n acc) (+ n acc)) 0 (lists:seq 1 6)))
42
```

For that to work, you will either need to have ``lfe`` in your path, or be in
an LFE project directory that you created with ``lfetool``.


### 10.2.4 Working with LFE Projects

If you've got an LFE project you have already created and want to see how it
runs on Erjang with ``jlfe``, go ahead and start up the ``jlfe`` REPL in that
project directory -- ``cd`` to your project dir and start the REPL like we did
in the above example.

For those that don't have one, try this out:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lfe/exemplar.git
$ cd exemplar
$ lfetool repl jlfe
LFE Shell V5.10.4 (abort with ^G)
```

Now start up the REPL and call some functions:

```cl
> (slurp '"src/exemplar-html.lfe")
#(ok exemplar-html)
> (p '"My paragraph.")
"<p>My paragraph.</p>"
> (html (body (div (p '"A paragraph in my page."))))
"<html><body><div><p>A paragraph in my page.</p></div></body></html>"
>
```

### 10.2.5 Calling Java from LFE


#### 10.2.5.1 Static Method on a Class

Here's an example of calling as static method on a Java class from LFE:

```cl
> (java.lang.Math:sin 0.5)
0.479425538604203
>
```

#### 10.2.5.2 Static Field on a Class

For right now, in order to activate the Erjang BIFs ``java:get_static/2`` and
``java:call/4``, you need to create ``java`` module:

```bash
cat > java.lfe
(defmodule java)

(defun noop ()
 'noop)
^D
```

Once your ``java`` module is compiled, you'll be able to access static fields:

```bash
$ lfetool repl jlfe
```

```cl
> (c 'java)
#(module java)
> (java:get_static 'java.lang.Math 'PI)
3.141592653589793
```


#### 10.2.5.3 Member on an Instance

In order to call members on instances, you need to create an instance first:

```cl
> (set rand-obj (java.util.Random:new))
#B()
```

You can confirm the type that you just created:

```cl
> (java:call rand-obj 'getClass '() '())
java.util.Random
```

Erjang's ``java:call/4`` function takes two additional parameters that we're
not using right now: types and arguments.

Here's how you call the various ``Random`` instance methods:

```cl
> (call rand-obj 'nextInt)
1845347843
> (call rand-obj 'nextDouble)
0.34850947916661346
```

You may also make the Erjang call:

```cl
> (java:call rand-obj 'nextInt '() '())
-2083227816
> (java:call rand-obj 'nextDouble '() '())
0.8218552203785259
```


#### 10.2.5.4 Working with Files from Java
